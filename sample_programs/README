Sample programs:

        alphabet.s      Prints A through Z to the terminal. Demonstrates basic
                        terminal output.
        colors.s        Prints a bunch of A's in different colors using vterm
                        mode. Demonstrates paints and vterm output.
        echo.s          Echos everything read from stdin to stdout, transforming
                        letters into uppercase. Demonstrates terminal input.
        minigame.s      Move a character around a vterm with hjkl. Demonstrates
                        a more complex vterm application.
        spam.s          Writes A through Z repeatedly, filling the vterm.
                        Demonstrates vterm output and how to do indirect
                        addressing to address the whole vterm.
